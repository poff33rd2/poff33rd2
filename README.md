- 👋 Hi, I’m Prentice Lathon
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a program developer 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python for backend operations along with JavaScript development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on backend and infrastructure dev projects to be able to develop custom interactions via API and Databases.

- ⚡ I think coding is an art because every input and output can be interpreted differently, creating a verse of access, control, and interaction.
